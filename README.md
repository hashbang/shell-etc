## About ##

This is the '/etc' directory of the #! shell servers.
Git management is handled via [etckeeper](http://etckeeper.branchable.com/)

New servers added to the pool will also have this configuration to give users an equal experience.

## Requirements ##

  * Debian 7+

## Contribution ##

Making changes to this repo will require a running #! [shell server](https://github.com/hashbang/shell-server).

An easy way to set this up locally is by running our latest shell-server 
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashbang/shell-server/).

A command like the following can get you going with a local development server:

```
docker run -d \
  -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
  -v $PWD:/etc-git \
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro \
  --name shell-server \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  hashbang/shell-server
```

From here you can enter this environment with:

```
docker exec -it shell-server bash
```

In this environment you can make updates and install packages with ```apt-get```.
Changes will automatically be committed and pushed to your working shell-etc
checkout by etckeeper. Assuming you chose to mount your .gitconfig above, the
changes should be attributed correctly as you.

Any changes made to /etc without apt-get will need to be committed/pushed in
place, which should be reflected in your local checkout as well.

When you are ready to contribute your changes upstream, please push to a branch
or a fork and make a pull request.

Note: the above workflow is only suitable for making very basic changes like
new package installations etc. If you want to do something more complex that
requires interaction with a user database, etc, please consider using our
end-to-end local development setup, documented here: [hashbang/hashbang](https://github.com/hashbang/hashbang)

### GPG signing ###

If you prefer to GPG sign your commits, a couple of options exist.

#### Manual ####

One, is you can simply use the above workflow as-is and just sign your last
commit before pushing with:
```
git commit -S --amend
```

For multiple commits you could do a rebase and change "pick" to "edit":
```
git rebase -i --root
```

Then for each commit you want to sign:
```
git commit -S --amend --no-edit && git rebase --continue 
```

#### Automatic ####

Assuming you use git auto-signing and have ssh-agents set up properly,
you can opt to expose your gpg/ssh sockets by adding the following arguments
to your docker run command:

```
...
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro \
  -v $HOME/.gnupg:/root/.gnupg \
  -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/root/.ssh-agent \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/root/.ssh-agent \
...
```
